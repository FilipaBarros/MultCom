# MultCom

These small projects were developed under the context of a Multimedia Communications course in the Technical University of Munich.

In the first one (part1.py and Project_1_report.pdf) we were requested to measure the bottleneck link rate of a connection.
In the second one (Multimedia_Content_Retrieval.py and Project_2_report.pdf) we were assigned the task of retrieving multimedia content.

The code is thoroughly explained in the respective read me of each part.
